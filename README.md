# Tacking of the progress of my PhD

In this project, I'll provide documents helping my supervisors to keep a track of the work carried out during my PhD. My subject is the detection of objects in road scenes in adverse weather conditions using Deep Learning and polarimetric imaging.

## Overvoew of the content

In this project you'll find several reports summing up the work I carried out weekly and keeping a track of what was being said during meetings. You'll also find some small experiments I made, using new algorithms or databases.
